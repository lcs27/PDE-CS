This folder contains the result of GitHub Action for the EDP project: ***The force applied on a stone in the Yvette river***   
## Explication
The calculate details are availiable with [this link](https://github.com/lcs27/cours-edp/actions/runs/643395070).
To reduce the time of calculate, the 200 samples are calculated by multi tasking, with 10 tasks at the same time and thus for each result there are 10 files.
## Content
In this folder, there are(N stands for the number of task):
- For case 1:
  - U0sN.txt, the river center velocity.
  - force_U0sN.txt, the force applied on the stone.
  - max_velocity_U0sN.txt, the maximum of river velocity.
- For case 2:
  - phisN.txt, the diameter of the stone.
  - force_phisN.txt, the force applied on the stone.
  - max_velocity_phisN.txt, the maximum of river velocity.
- For case 3:
  - YsN.txt, the position of the stone.
  - force_YsN.txt, the force applied on the stone.
  - max_velocity_YsN.txt, the maximum of river velocity.
